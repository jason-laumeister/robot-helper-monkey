This website is constructed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). 

Thank to the folks who created the Hugo [Ananke theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke) that is used as a base for this site. Also thanks to [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io).

Inexpensive and adequate domain name registration can be had at [namesilo.com](https://www.namesilo.com/).

The previous Jekyll version of this site used [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to provide SSL support. I might do that again, if only for the caching and AI bot protection. See ["Secure and fast GitHub Pages with CloudFlare"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/). 

[Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/) are an excellent way to include common javascript libraries hosted on the Google CDN services. These are widely used, so it's likely that these are already in the browser cache of your target audience too.
